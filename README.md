# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repository contains the R code, documentation files and the resulting tidy data set of the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning data" project.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

1. `run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file. 
  * The code downloads and unzips the data in the same folder
  * It then performs the subsequent data analysis from step one to step five

2. `CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

3. The output of the 5th step is called `averages_data.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
